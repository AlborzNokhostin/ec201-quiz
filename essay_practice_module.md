## Essay 1: Transversality Condition ⭐⭐⭐

### Question:
**"Can a country run perpetual current account deficits? Explain using the transversality condition. What does this condition actually require?" (14 marks)**

### Why This Question?
Professor said **"I'll probably put it on the test for sure"** and **"I want everybody to get this right."** This is the most explicitly guaranteed test question.

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**Introduction (2 marks):**
The transversality condition is a key sustainability constraint for international borrowing. A country CAN potentially run perpetual current account deficits, but only if the transversality condition is satisfied.

**The Transversality Condition (4 marks):**
The condition states:
```
lim[t→∞] B_t/(1+r)^t = 0
```

**Crucially, this does NOT mean debt must be zero** (B_t → 0). It means the **present discounted value** of debt must go to zero. This is satisfied when:
- Growth rate of debt < Interest rate (g_B < r)

**Intuition (3 marks):**
- If debt grows slower than r, then B_t/(1+r)^t → 0 even if B_t → ∞
- The country must generate sufficient trade balance surpluses to service the debt
- Cannot use "Ponzi scheme" (borrowing to pay interest forever)

**Example (3 marks):**
Suppose r = 5% per year. A country can run CA deficits forever IF:
- The debt grows at, say, 3% per year (g_B = 3% < 5% = r)
- The present value: B_t/(1.05)^t → 0 as t → ∞

**Conclusion (2 marks):**
Yes, perpetual CA deficits are possible under the transversality condition. The key is that debt servicing must come from real resources (GDP growth, future surpluses), not perpetual borrowing.

**Common mistake to avoid:** Do NOT say "debt must be zero in the limit" - that's worth -10 points according to the professor!

## Essay 2: Global Saving Glut ⭐⭐⭐

### Question:
**"Explain the Global Saving Glut hypothesis. According to this view, why were US interest rates low in the 2000s? What is the evidence for or against this hypothesis?" (14 marks)**

### Why This Question?
Week 7 had 22 test/exam mentions, with 10+ specifically about Global Saving Glut. Professor said "definitely on the test."

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**The Hypothesis (4 marks):**
The Global Saving Glut (Bernanke, 2005) attributes low US interest rates in the 2000s to excessive saving in emerging markets:
- China: Export-led growth, undervalued currency, high saving rates
- Oil exporters: High oil prices (2000s) → large CA surpluses → petrodollar recycling
- Asian countries: Precautionary saving after 1997 Asian Financial Crisis

**Mechanism (4 marks):**
1. Emerging markets ran large CA surpluses → capital outflows
2. Bought US assets (especially Treasury bonds) → demand for US debt ↑
3. US interest rates fell (r* ↓)
4. Low r* enabled US households/firms to borrow cheaply
5. US CA deficit widened to match foreign surpluses (global CA sum = 0)

**Evidence Supporting (3 marks):**
✅ Asian saving rates rose dramatically (especially China from 35% to 50% of GDP)
✅ Emerging market CA surpluses widened significantly in 2000s
✅ Timing matches: saving glut coincides with low US rates
✅ Foreign holdings of US Treasuries soared

**Evidence Against / Alternative (Investment Drought) (2 marks):**
❌ Alternative explanation (Summers): Low r* from falling investment demand (secular stagnation)
- But data shows investment was relatively stable, not falling
- Saving increase more pronounced in data

**Conclusion (1 mark):**
Evidence strongly supports Saving Glut over Investment Drought. The hypothesis also explains the link to 2008 crisis (low r* → search for yield → excessive risk-taking).

## Essay 3: NIIP and Valuation Changes ⭐⭐

### Question:
**"Why might a country's Net International Investment Position (NIIP) not equal its accumulated current account balances? Explain with reference to the US NIIP puzzle. (14 marks)**

### Why This Question?
Professor said "This is going to be on the test for sure" when discussing valuation changes.

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**NIIP Definition (2 marks):**
NIIP = Foreign Assets - Foreign Liabilities
It measures a country's net wealth position vis-à-vis the rest of the world.

**Two Sources of NIIP Changes (4 marks):**
1. **Current Account Flows:**
   - CA surplus → accumulate foreign assets → NIIP ↑
   - CA deficit → accumulate foreign liabilities → NIIP ↓

2. **Valuation Changes:**
   - Stock market price changes
   - Bond price changes
   - Exchange rate movements
   - These change the VALUE of existing assets/liabilities without any flow

**The US Puzzle (4 marks):**
During 2002-2007:
- US ran $3.9 trillion in CA deficits
- Expected: NIIP should fall by $3.9 trillion
- **Actual: NIIP improved by $80 billion! (+$4 trillion swing)**

How? **Positive valuation changes of ~$4 trillion offset the CA deficits.**

**Explanation (2 marks):**
- US holds foreign assets mainly in stocks/FDI (risky, high return)
- Foreigners hold US assets mainly in bonds/Treasuries (safe, low return)
- When global stock markets rose, US foreign assets appreciated more than US foreign liabilities
- "Exorbitant privilege" of dollar → return differential

**Conclusion (2 marks):**
NIIP ≠ Accumulated CA because valuation effects matter. The US benefits from composition of its foreign portfolio (holds equity, owes debt).

**Formula:**
```
Δ NIIP_t = CA_t + Valuation Changes_t
```

## Essay 4: Metzler Diagram Application ⭐⭐

### Question:
**"Using the Metzler diagram, analyze the effects of a temporary government spending increase on the current account. How would your answer differ if the spending increase were permanent?" (14 marks)**

### Why This Question?
Week 6 had 10 test mentions about Metzler diagram. Professor said "This will definitely be on the test."

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**Setup (2 marks):**
The Metzler diagram plots:
- Vertical axis: world interest rate r*
- Horizontal axis: current account CA
- Upward-sloping CA curve (higher r* → higher saving → better CA)

**Temporary Government Spending Increase (6 marks):**

*Draw diagram showing:*
1. Initial CA curve and equilibrium at r*₀, CA₀
2. G↑ (temporary) → National saving falls: S = Y - C - G ↓
3. CA = S - I → CA worsens
4. **CA curve shifts LEFT**
5. At unchanged r*₀, new equilibrium CA₁ < CA₀ (deficit worsens)
6. Magnitude: Large effect because temporary (no offsetting consumption change)

**Intuition:** Higher gov't spending reduces resources available for private saving → CA deteriorates.

**Permanent Government Spending Increase (4 marks):**

*If G↑ is permanent:*
1. Still shifts CA curve left, BUT smaller shift
2. Why? Ricardian equivalence logic: permanent G↑ → future taxes ↑
3. Households save more to prepare for higher future taxes
4. Partially offsets the direct effect of G↑ on national saving

**Net effect:** CA curve shifts left, but less than temporary case.

**Conclusion (2 marks):**
- Temporary G↑: Large leftward CA shift
- Permanent G↑: Smaller leftward CA shift
- In both cases, CA worsens, but magnitude differs

**Key distinction for test:** Temporary shocks have LARGER CA effects (no consumption smoothing offsets).

## Essay 5: Current Account Determinants ⭐⭐

### Question:
**"List and explain FIVE factors that determine a country's current account balance. For each factor, explain the direction of the effect." (14 marks)**

### Why This Question?
Week 7 explicitly reviewed CA determinants as test preparation. Professor: "These questions could appear on the test in various forms."

### Model Answer (14 marks - allocate ~2.8 marks per factor):

**Fundamental Relationship (1 mark):**
```
CA = S - I
```
Current account = National saving - Investment

**Factor 1: Temporary Income Increase (3 marks):**
- **Effect:** CA improves (surplus increases or deficit shrinks)
- **Mechanism:** Permanent income hypothesis → save windfall → S↑ → CA↑
- **Example:** Oil discovery country saves most of temporary oil revenue

**Factor 2: Anticipated Future Income (3 marks):**
- **Effect:** CA worsens (deficit increases)
- **Mechanism:** Borrow against future income to smooth consumption today → S↓ → CA↓
- **Example:** Developing country with good growth prospects borrows internationally

**Factor 3: World Interest Rate Increase (r*↑) (2 marks):**
- **Effect:** CA improves
- **Mechanism:** Substitution effect (log utility) → save more → S↑, and investment falls → I↓ → CA↑
- **Magnitude:** Large if intertemporal elasticity of substitution is high

**Factor 4: Government Spending Increase (2 marks):**
- **Effect:** CA worsens
- **Mechanism:** G↑ → national saving S = Y - C - G falls → CA↓
- **Fiscal expansion → CA deficit** (twin deficits)

**Factor 5: Patience Increase (Time Preference β↑) (2 marks):**
- **Effect:** CA improves
- **Mechanism:** More patient → value future more → save more today → S↑ → CA↑
- **Example:** Cultural shift toward higher saving rates

**Bonus Factor - Investment/Productivity Shock (1 mark for completeness):**
- Positive productivity shock → I↑ → CA worsens (if investment effect dominates saving effect)
- Temporary productivity shock → CA may improve (save windfall)
- Permanent productivity shock → small CA effect (consumption smoothing)

**Conclusion:** CA is determined by anything affecting national saving or investment. The fundamental identity CA = S - I is the key to analyzing all shocks.

## Essay 6: Temporary vs Permanent Shocks ⭐

### Question:
**"Compare the effects of a temporary versus permanent productivity increase on the current account. Why do these effects differ in magnitude?" (14 marks)**

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**Temporary Productivity Shock (6 marks):**

Current period: A₁↑, Future: A₂ unchanged

**Saving effect:**
- Q₁↑ but Q₂ unchanged
- Permanent income hypothesis: spread consumption increase over both periods
- Save most of Q₁ increase → S₁↑ (large)

**Investment effect:**
- Only temporary → MPK returns to normal next period
- I₁↑ slightly (build some capital to use while A₁ high)
- But effect is muted because shock is temporary

**Net CA effect:** CA₁ improves significantly (S↑ effect dominates I↑)

**Permanent Productivity Shock (6 marks):**

Both periods: A₁↑ AND A₂↑

**Saving effect:**
- Q₁↑ and Q₂↑ permanently
- Permanent income hypothesis: consumption C rises proportionally to Q in both periods
- S₁ = Y₁ - C₁ - G → small increase (C rises a lot)

**Investment effect:**
- Permanent ↑MPK → I₁↑ substantially (profitable to build capital stock permanently)
- Larger investment response than temporary case

**Net CA effect:** CA₁ may worsen OR small change (I↑ effect may dominate S effect)

**Key Difference (2 marks):**
Temporary shocks → large CA response (save the windfall)
Permanent shocks → small CA response (consumption smoothing + investment)

**Consumption smoothing is the key:** Temporary income changes are saved, permanent changes are consumed.

## Essay 7: Small vs Large Economy ⭐

### Question:
**"Explain the key difference between small open economy and large open economy models in terms of interest rate determination. How does this affect the analysis of policy changes?" (14 marks)**

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**Small Open Economy (4 marks):**
- **r* is exogenous** (taken as given from world markets)
- Country is too small to affect world interest rate
- **Example:** New Zealand, Denmark
- **Implication:** Policy changes affect CA but not r*
- Metzler diagram: r* is horizontal line, economy adjusts CA

**Large Open Economy (4 marks):**
- **r* is endogenous** (determined by global market clearing)
- Country's saving/investment decisions affect world interest rate
- **Example:** United States, China, Eurozone
- **Implication:** Policy changes affect both CA and r*
- Must account for feedback effects

**Feedback Effects in Large Economy (4 marks):**

**Example: Country A increases saving**

*Small economy case:*
- S↑ → CA improves by full amount of S↑
- r* unchanged → no feedback

*Large economy case:*
1. Direct effect: S↑ → CA_A shifts right (improvement)
2. **But:** S↑ globally → r*↓ (more capital supplied)
3. Lower r* → movement back along CA curve
4. **Net effect:** CA_A improves, but LESS than small economy case

**The feedback dampens the initial effect.**

**Policy Implications (2 marks):**
- Large economy must consider spillover effects on rest of world
- "Beggar-thy-neighbor" policies affect global r*
- Coordination problems: Both countries can't improve CA simultaneously (global sum = 0)

## Essay 8: Consumption Smoothing

### Question:
**"Explain the principle of consumption smoothing in the context of international macroeconomics. How does it help explain current account patterns?" (14 marks)**

### Model Answer (14 marks):

**Principle (4 marks):**
Rational households prefer stable consumption over time rather than volatile consumption that follows income fluctuations.

**Formal:** Utility is concave in consumption
```
U(C₁, C₂) = u(C₁) + βu(C₂)
where u''(C) < 0 → diminishing marginal utility
```

**Implication:** Smooth consumption → save windfalls, borrow against future income

**Temporary Income Changes (4 marks):**

**Positive shock (Q₁↑, Q₂ unchanged):**
- Don't increase C₁ by full amount of Q₁↑
- Instead, save most of windfall to spread over lifetime
- **CA₁ improves** (running surplus, accumulating foreign assets)

**Example:** Norway's oil fund - save oil revenues for future generations

**Negative shock (Q₁↓, Q₂ unchanged):**
- Don't cut C₁ by full amount of Q₁↓
- Instead, borrow internationally to maintain consumption
- **CA₁ worsens** (running deficit, accumulating foreign debt)

**Example:** Country facing temporary natural disaster borrows internationally

**Permanent Income Changes (3 marks):**

**Permanent increase (Q₁↑, Q₂↑):**
- "Permanent income" is higher
- Can safely increase consumption in all periods
- **CA₁ change is small** (C rises with Q)

**Permanent income hypothesis:** Only *permanent* income changes affect consumption proportionally.

**Empirical Support (2 marks):**
✅ CA deficits in developing countries (borrowing against future growth)
✅ CA surpluses in aging societies (Japan - saving for retirement)
✅ Oil-rich countries save windfalls (consumption smoothing across generations)

**Conclusion (1 mark):**
Consumption smoothing via international borrowing/lending is the fundamental driver of current account dynamics. It explains why CA ≠ 0 is optimal.
