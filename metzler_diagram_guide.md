## ⚠️ Professor's Emphasis

> **"The Metzler diagram is one of the most important tools we'll use, and you absolutely need to master this for the test. I want you to be able to draw the Metzler diagram, label the axes correctly, show how CA and r are related. **This will definitely be on the test** - I might give you a shock and ask you to show the effects on the diagram."**

**Frequency:** Mentioned 10 times in Week 6 lecture (most emphasized single topic in that week)

## 📐 What is the Metzler Diagram?

The **Metzler diagram** is a graphical tool that shows the relationship between:
- **World interest rate (r\*)** → vertical axis
- **Current Account (CA)** → horizontal axis

It's used to analyze how different economic shocks affect a country's current account balance in a small open economy.

## ✅ Essential Checklist: What You MUST Include

### When Drawing the Metzler Diagram:

- [ ] **Vertical Axis:** Labeled as "r*" (world interest rate)
- [ ] **Horizontal Axis:** Labeled as "CA" (current account)
- [ ] **Zero line:** Vertical line at CA = 0 (balanced current account)
- [ ] **CA Curve:** Upward sloping curve
- [ ] **Equilibrium Point:** Where CA curve intersects the given r* level
- [ ] **Arrows:** Show direction of movement if analyzing a shock
- [ ] **Labels:** Clearly mark "CA curve" and any shifts

### Key Concept to Remember:
**The CA curve slopes UPWARD** because:
- Higher r* → Saving becomes more attractive (substitution effect dominates with log utility)
- Higher saving → Improved current account
- Therefore: ↑r* → ↑CA

## 🎨 Step-by-Step Drawing Guide

### Step 1: Draw the Axes
```
r* (interest rate)
│
│
│
│
└─────────────────── CA (current account)
         0
```

### Step 2: Mark Key Points
- Draw a vertical line at CA = 0 (balanced CA)
- Mark positive CA (surplus) to the right of 0
- Mark negative CA (deficit) to the left of 0

### Step 3: Draw the CA Curve
- Start from bottom-left (low r*, CA deficit)
- Slope **upward** to top-right (high r*, CA surplus)
- Label it "CA curve"

```
r*
│     /
│    /  CA curve
│   /
│  /
│ /
└─────────────────── CA
       0
```

### Step 4: Mark Equilibrium
- Choose a r* level (given by world markets in small open economy)
- Find where this r* intersects the CA curve
- This is the equilibrium CA

## 🔄 Analyzing Shocks

### Shift vs. Movement:

| Type | Cause | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Movement along CA curve** | Change in r* | Move up/down the existing curve |
| **Shift of CA curve** | Change in fundamentals (preferences, productivity, gov't spending) | Entire curve moves left or right |

### What Shifts the CA Curve Right (Improvement)?
✅ Decrease in government spending (↑ national saving)
✅ Increase in patience (β↑) → save more
✅ Decrease in investment demand
✅ Temporary income increase (save windfall)

### What Shifts the CA Curve Left (Worsening)?
❌ Increase in government spending (↓ national saving)
❌ Decrease in patience (β↓) → consume more
❌ Increase in investment demand
❌ Expected future income increase (borrow today)

## 📝 Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Basic Drawing
**Task:** Draw a Metzler diagram for a small open economy with r* = 5% and CA = 100.

**Solution checklist:**
- Axes labeled correctly ✓
- CA curve slopes upward ✓
- Point marked at (CA=100, r*=5%) ✓

---

### Problem 2: Government Spending Increase
**Question:** Using the Metzler diagram, show the effect of a temporary increase in government spending. Assume r* stays constant at 5%.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Draw initial equilibrium (CA₀ at r*=5%)
2. Gov't spending ↑ → National saving ↓ → CA worsens
3. **CA curve shifts LEFT**
4. New equilibrium: CA₁ < CA₀ (moved left along r*=5%)
5. Label: "Initial CA curve" and "New CA curve (after G↑)"

**Key insight:** Fiscal expansion worsens CA by reducing national saving.

---

### Problem 3: World Interest Rate Rise
**Question:** The world interest rate rises from 5% to 7%. Show the effect on CA.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Draw initial equilibrium at r*=5%, some CA₀
2. r* rises to 7%
3. **Movement along CA curve** (upward and rightward)
4. New equilibrium: CA₁ > CA₀
5. Draw horizontal arrow from old point to new point

**Key insight:** Higher r* → CA improves via substitution effect (save more).

---

### Problem 4: Temporary vs. Permanent Productivity Shock

**Scenario A: Temporary productivity increase (only current period)**
- Current income ↑ but future income unchanged
- Consumption smoothing → save most of windfall
- **CA curve shifts RIGHT (large improvement)**

**Scenario B: Permanent productivity increase (current + future)**
- Current income ↑ AND future income ↑
- Consumption rises proportionally
- Investment also rises
- **CA curve shifts slightly (small net effect, possibly left if investment dominates)**

**Key insight:** Temporary shocks have LARGER CA effects than permanent shocks.

---

### Problem 5: Comprehensive Scenario
**Question:** Suppose an economy experiences:
1. Increase in patience (β↑)
2. Simultaneously, world interest rate falls

**Analyze:** What happens to CA? Is the effect ambiguous?

**Solution:**
1. β↑ → Save more → **CA curve shifts RIGHT**
2. r*↓ → **Movement down along the (new) CA curve**

**Net effect:**
- Direct effect of β↑: CA improves (rightward shift)
- But lower r* partially offsets this (movement back left along curve)
- **CA improves, but less than the shift alone would suggest**

## 🎯 Test Strategy Tips

### What the Professor Will Likely Ask:

1. **Draw the diagram** (blank → full diagram with labels)
2. **Show a shock** (e.g., "Show government spending increase")
3. **Shift vs. movement** (True/False: "r* increase causes CA curve to shift")
4. **Direction** (Multiple choice: "Temporary income increase shifts CA curve [left/right]")

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Drawing CA curve with **downward** slope (WRONG!)
❌ Confusing shift vs. movement
❌ Forgetting to label axes
❌ Not showing direction of arrows when analyzing shocks
❌ Mixing up temporary vs. permanent effects

### Memory Aids:

**"SUIR"** - Substitution Upward Interest Rate
- **S**ubstitution effect dominates (with log utility)
- **U**pward sloping CA curve
- **I**nterest rate on vertical axis
- **R**ightward shift = CA improvement

**"SIFTER"** for what shifts the curve:
- **S**aving changes (patience, time preference)
- **I**nvestment changes
- **F**iscal policy (government spending)
- **T**emporary income shocks (large effect)
- **E**xpected future income (causes borrowing today)
- **R**emember: r* change is movement, not shift!

## 📚 Related Concepts

### Connection to Other Topics:

- **Week 3 (Euler Equation):** The upward slope comes from the Euler equation with substitution effect dominating
- **Week 5 (Investment):** Investment changes shift the CA curve (CA = S - I)
- **Week 7 (Two-Country Model):** In large economy, CA shift affects r* → feedback effects

### Formula Reminder:

**Current Account Identity:**
```
CA = S - I
```

Where:
- S = National Saving = Y - C - G (output minus consumption minus government spending)
- I = Investment

**Why CA curve slopes up:**
```
↑r* → ↑S (substitution: consume less today, save more)
↑r* → ↓I (higher cost of capital)
Both effects → ↑CA = S - I
```

## 🏆 Self-Test Questions

### Quick Check (Answers at bottom):

1. What axis is r* on? (Vertical/Horizontal)
2. Does the CA curve slope up or down?
3. Government spending increase causes CA curve to shift (Left/Right)?
4. r* increase causes (Movement/Shift)?
5. Temporary income increase has (Larger/Smaller) effect than permanent?

### Answers:
1. Vertical
2. Upward (positive slope)
3. Left (worsens CA)
4. Movement (along the curve)
5. Larger (save the windfall)

## 🎓 Exam Preparation Advice

**From the professor:**
> "Being able to use the Metzler diagram is crucial for the test, and it's also important for the exam. The test will definitely have a Metzler question. You need to know what shifts the CA curve and what's a movement along the curve - this distinction will be tested."

### Time Allocation:
- If given 5 minutes for Metzler question on test:
  - 1 min: Draw axes and CA curve
  - 2 min: Show the shock and shifts/movements
  - 2 min: Explain the economic intuition

### Practice Routine:
1. Draw the diagram 10 times from memory
2. Practice each type of shock (G↑, β↑, A↑, r*↑)
3. Do 3 comprehensive problems combining multiple shocks
4. Time yourself: can you draw and explain in 5 minutes?
