// Week 6: Metzler Diagram & Saving - Hard (15 questions)
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Metzler Diagram Analysis",
    question: "Consider a small open economy in the Metzler diagram. A temporary positive productivity shock shifts the CA curve right, but then the world interest rate falls. What is the net effect on CA?",
    options: ["CA unambiguously improves (both effects positive)", "CA may improve less than the initial shift suggests due to r* feedback", "CA worsens despite the productivity shock", "CA is unchanged due to offsetting effects"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The productivity shock shifts CA curve right (improvement). But if this is a large economy effect, r* falls, causing a movement back along the curve. Net effect: CA improves, but less than initial shift.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 8-15"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Saving and Investment",
    question: "In a small open economy, suppose saving increases by 100 and investment increases by 60. What happens to the current account?",
    options: ["Worsens by 40", "Improves by 40", "Worsens by 160", "Improves by 160"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "CA = S - I. If S↑100 and I↑60, then ΔCA = 100 - 60 = +40. CA improves by 40.",

},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Metzler Diagram Shifts",
    question: "Which of the following causes a rightward shift of the CA curve in the Metzler diagram?",
    options: ["Increase in world interest rate r*", "Decrease in time preference (households become more impatient)", "Decrease in government spending", "Permanent increase in expected future income"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Rightward shift means CA improves at every r*. This happens when: S↑ (gov't spending↓, patience↑) or I↓. Lower gov't spending raises national saving → CA curve shifts right.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 8-15"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Temporary vs Permanent Shocks",
    question: "Compare a temporary vs permanent income increase. Which has a larger effect on the current account?",
    options: ["Permanent increase has larger effect", "Temporary increase has larger effect", "Both have identical effects", "Permanent increase worsens CA while temporary improves it"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Temporary income: save most of windfall → large CA improvement. Permanent income: C rises proportionally → small CA effect. Consumption smoothing implies temporary shocks have larger CA effects.",

},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Interest Rate Effects",
    question: "With log utility, when the world interest rate increases, what happens to period 1 consumption?",
    options: ["C<sub>1</sub> increases (income effect dominates)", "C<sub>1</sub> decreases (substitution effect dominates)", "C<sub>1</sub> is unchanged (effects cancel)", "C<sub>1</sub> may increase or decrease depending on initial wealth"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "With log utility, substitution effect always dominates. Higher r makes C₁ more expensive → C₁ decreases, C₂ increases. This is why CA curve slopes upward.",

    options: ["The economy is now running a CA deficit", "The economy's CA has improved", "Domestic investment must have increased", "Domestic saving must have decreased"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Rightward shift with unchanged r* means the economy moves to a better CA position (more to the right on horizontal axis). CA has improved.",

    options: ["Permanent increase in government spending (builds infrastructure)", "Temporary increase in government spending (stimulus)", "Temporary decrease in government spending (austerity)", "Subsidizing consumption to boost domestic demand"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "To improve CA, need S↑ or I↓. Temporary decrease in gov't spending raises national saving → CA improves. Options 0,1,3 all worsen CA by reducing saving or boosting consumption.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 16-22"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Discount Factor Changes",

    options: ["CA curve shifts right, CA improves at given r*", "CA curve shifts left, CA worsens at given r*", "CA curve becomes steeper but doesn't shift", "r* increases but CA curve is unchanged"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Lower β means households value present more → consume more today, save less → national saving falls → CA worsens. CA curve shifts left.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 16-22"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Investment and Current Account",

},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",

    options: ["Unambiguously improves (both effects positive)", "Unambiguously worsens (both effects negative)", "Ambiguous (opposing effects)", "No change (effects exactly cancel)"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Temporary income increase → S↑ → CA improves. But β↓ (more impatient) → S↓ → CA worsens. Net effect ambiguous, depends on relative magnitudes.",

},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Metzler Diagram Slopes",
    question: "Why does the CA curve in the Metzler diagram slope upward?",
    options: ["Higher r* increases investment, improving CA", "Higher r* reduces saving via income effect, worsening CA", "Higher r* increases saving via substitution effect, improving CA", "Higher r* has no effect on CA"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "With log utility, substitution effect dominates: higher r* makes C₁ more expensive → save more → CA improves. This creates the upward slope.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 8-15"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Open Economy Dynamics",
    question: "In a two-period model with Metzler diagram, if CA<sub>1</sub> > 0 (surplus in period 1), what must be true about period 2?",
    options: ["CA<sub>2</sub> must also be positive", "CA<sub>2</sub> must be negative (the economy consumes foreign assets)", "CA<sub>2</sub> must equal zero", "CA<sub>2</sub> can be positive or negative, no restriction"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "With terminal condition B₂=0, a surplus in period 1 (CA₁>0, B₁>0) means the economy accumulated assets. In period 2, must run CA₂<0 to consume those assets and return to B₂=0.",

},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Consumption Smoothing",
    question: "An economy expects high future income but has low current income. According to consumption smoothing with a Metzler diagram, the economy should:",
    options: ["Run CA surplus today (save for future)", "Run CA deficit today (borrow against future income)", "Have balanced CA today", "Increase investment to raise current income"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Low Q₁ but high Q₂ → want to smooth consumption → borrow today (CA₁<0) and repay tomorrow. The CA curve shifts left when future income is expected.",

{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "Comparative Statics",
    question: "Consider the elasticity of CA with respect to r*. Which economy has higher elasticity?",
    options: ["Economy with high intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES)", "Economy with low intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES)", "Elasticity is the same for all economies", "Elasticity depends only on income, not preferences"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Higher IES means stronger willingness to substitute consumption across time. When r* rises, high IES economies adjust consumption more → larger CA response → steeper CA curve → higher elasticity.",
    slideRef: "Lecture 6, Slides 8-15"
},
{
    week: 6,
    difficulty: "hard",
    topic: "General Equilibrium",
    question: "In a Metzler diagram for a small open economy, the economy is currently running CA=0. If productivity permanently increases, what is the likely new equilibrium?",
    options: ["Large CA surplus (CA >> 0)", "Small CA surplus or deficit, close to zero", "Large CA deficit (CA << 0)", "CA remains exactly zero"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Permanent productivity increase: Q rises (→ S↑ → CA↑) but also future income rises (→ C↑ → S↓ → CA↓) AND investment rises (→ CA↓). Effects mostly offset → small net CA change.",

    question: "In a two-country model, Country A has high current endowment but low future endowment, while Country B has the opposite. What is the equilibrium pattern of CAs?",
    options: ["Both countries have balanced CAs", "A runs CA surplus in period 1, B runs CA deficit", "A runs CA deficit in period 1, B runs CA surplus", "Impossible to determine without knowing preferences"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A has comparative advantage 'today' (high Q₁, low Q₂) → produces more today → lends to B → CA_A > 0 in period 1. B borrows from A, repays in period 2. This is intertemporal trade.",

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Key evidence: Emerging market (especially Asian) CA surpluses widened dramatically after 1997 Asian crisis and 2000s oil price rise. This is exactly what Saving Glut predicts.",

    question: "In a two-country model, Country A increases investment demand (positive productivity shock). What is the feedback effect on Country A's current account?",
    options: ["No feedback (same as small economy)", "Feedback dampens the CA deterioration (r*↑ raises saving)", "Feedback amplifies the CA deterioration (r*↓ reduces saving)", "Feedback eliminates any CA change"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Direct effect: I↑ → CA worsens. But in two-country model: A's I↑ → r*↑ → saving increases → partially offsets CA worsening. Feedback dampens (doesn't eliminate) the CA deterioration.",

    question: "In a two-country model, Country A makes a unilateral transfer to Country B. What is the effect on A's current account?",
    options: ["CA_A worsens by exactly the transfer amount", "CA_A worsens by more than the transfer (if A has high marginal propensity to import)", "CA_A worsens by less than the transfer (consumption adjusts)", "CA_A may improve if B saves the transfer"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "This is the Transfer Problem (Keynes vs. Ohlin): Direct effect (CA↓ by transfer) plus secondary effect (A's income↓ → C_A↓ → CA↑ partially offsetting). If A has high MPI, secondary effect is large.",

    options: ["Both CAs improve as planned", "Both CAs are unchanged (r* falls, offsetting austerity)", "Both CAs worsen (coordination failure)", "One CA improves, the other worsens"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Both countries: G↓ → S↑. But CA_A + CA_B = 0 always, so both can't improve CAs simultaneously. r* falls sharply, offsetting the CA improvement. This illustrates coordination problem and 'fallacy of composition'.",

    options: ["US should have increased saving/reduced borrowing despite low r*", "China should have increased saving further", "Oil exporters should have consumed less", "No policy could have helped"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "If Saving Glut correct: low r* enabled excessive US borrowing and risk-taking. Better policy: resist the cheap credit, increase saving, regulate financial sector to prevent bubbles. Though politically difficult to 'not borrow' when rates are low.",
