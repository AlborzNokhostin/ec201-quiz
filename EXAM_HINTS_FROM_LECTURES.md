## **OCTOBER 9, 2025 - WEEK 1: GLOBAL IMBALANCES**

### **Part 1: Course Organization & Test Format**

**Context:** Professor discussing test format and structure

> "Now what the format of the test, it's gonna be in person, so you'll have **8 multiple choice questions. I think most of it is gonna be true, false and. Yeah, multiple choice. And then you'll have two short essay questions and it's gonna be 14 marks each**, so that's gonna be the format of the test."

**Context:** Professor explaining what material will be covered

> "Day and test is on a Monday so I might, I might actually make it from weeks 1 to 7 so I don't want to teach something hard in week 8 and then you have to spend a weekend and stress about uh what if there is a question about week 8. That's not, that's not the point. So I'll do it from 1 to 7. So you have it recorded here and uh you can come. OK, so **whatever we cover in the first seven weeks of the term will be on the test on December 1st**."

**Context:** Professor emphasizing importance of practice problems

> "And then parts B and C are going to be much more challenging. So these are going to be questions, both B and C, that **are going to prepare you for the exam**. So you're not first years anymore, you know what exams are, you know that you are gonna probably panic if you are. Type that panics during the exam and you have to beat that and how do you beat that?"

> "So the more you do of these exercises, the more you put yourself in these situations, the **better you're gonna do in the exam. And these questions B and C are going to be quite representative, especially the C part of what you might see, uh, in the exam** and the test a little bit less because that is just um. Uh, quick questions, OK?"

**Context:** Professor encouraging students to do well on test

> "Now I can't stress enough how important it is that you study for that test because **usually tests are easier than exams and it's like a free 20% for you**. No, I want you all to do well on the test and then on the exam you have a little, so if you do very well on the test, you're, oh yeah, I have 20%. I can mess up a little bit on the exam and still do well, OK."

## **OCTOBER 16, 2025 - WEEK 2: CURRENT ACCOUNT SUSTAINABILITY**

**HINT 4: Transversality Condition - Growth Rate vs Interest Rate**

**Topic:** What transversality condition actually means

**Context:** Explaining that debt doesn't have to be zero, but can't grow faster than interest rate

> "The condition doesn't say that that in the as as uh time goes to infinity has to be equal to zero. The condition says that **the debt cannot grow faster than the interest rate, OK**, because we will never see the country that is going to say, OK, the debt is 0, we settled everything, OK, so that's not realistic. It's the growth rate of debt that is going to matter, and that's what the transferability condition is telling us. **It's not telling us that the debt should be**..."

**Context:** Professor says she will definitely ask this

> "So if the debt grows higher than the, uh, faster, so even the, the growth rate is higher than the interest rate, then you see that the transversality condition will not hold, and this is not going to be sustainable. OK, **so this is very important. I'll probably put it on the test for sure, something, some version of this question**."

**What she's talking about:** Common misconception - transversality condition does NOT mean debt = 0 in the limit. It means present discounted value of debt → 0, which happens when growth rate of debt < interest rate. If you answer "debt must be zero" on test, she says you'll get "-10 points"!

## **OCTOBER 23, 2025 - WEEK 3: THEORY OF CURRENT ACCOUNT**

**HINT 5: Endogenous vs Exogenous Variables**

**Topic:** Identifying what's chosen (endogenous) vs what's given (exogenous) in models

**Context:** Explaining model setup

> "So again, we have a model, and we have some constraints. We are maximizing something, deciding how much to consume, OK. So what we are choosing is something that is endogenous, and what's given to us is just exogenous, so we can't do anything about that, it's just, you know, given uh given to us so we can take it into account, so that's why I wrote here what endogenous variables are, what exogenous variables are, **so this is something I might ask on the test. I'll give you an example and say what are the exogenous variables in this example, what are the endogenous variables**,"

**What she's talking about:** In the small open economy model, consumption (C1, C2) is endogenous (we choose it), while income/endowment (Q1, Q2) and interest rate (r) are exogenous (given to us)

---

**HINT 6: Accounting Identities - Don't Memorize, Derive!**

**Topic:** How to remember current account identity

**Context:** Explaining how to derive formulas instead of memorizing

> "So then if you plug in and then what is this guy, the net investment, uh, income investment is the return on the assets that we own, OK? So this is gonna be the R. OK, times. The assets that we have at the beginning of period T, which is what we had when we finished period T minus 1, OK? So that's just a return. So this is all that we are doing here, uh, in this slide is just representing accounting identities. **So if you ever get stuck on the exam, oh my god, I forgot, is it BT. T minus 1. Don't study by heart. Just you just have to remember this identity here and this identity here, which is quite logical**. So the current account, goods and services, then what happened to the income, to the labor, to the two factors, and net unilateral transfers. OK, **so don't study by heart, uh-huh, CAT CBT plus RBT minus 1, but you have no idea where. That comes from, so just remember the identities from week one and work it out, so don't panic if you kind of block on the exam is it RBT -1 or BT**, so you should be able to logically work out where these come from, OK?"

**What she's talking about:** CA_t = TB_t + r*B_{t-1} + NUT - derive this from basic identities, don't just memorize it

---

**HINT 7: Transversality Condition (Again!) - True/False Question**

**Topic:** Present discounted value of debt, NOT debt itself

**Context:** Repeating the most important concept from Week 2

> "Then we said, and **this I said will be the question that I will ask on the test because I want everybody to get on that question**. It's like a test to see how much you're listening. To get 100, I mean, I want everybody to get it right. **There will be something true or false.  25%So we said that the infinite horizon, it doesn't mean, so this condition here doesn't mean that debt will be zero as time goes to infinity, but the present discount value of that is going to zero**, which means that you cannot. Run that by not, you know, supporting that debt from some real resources which are going to come from growth of the economy and uh in this uh simple model from uh sicit in the trade bouts."

**What she's talking about:** She REALLY wants everyone to get this right. The transversality condition is lim_{t→∞} B_t/(1+r)^t = 0, NOT lim_{t→∞} B_t = 0. This will be a true/false question.

## **OCTOBER 30, 2025 - WEEK 4: TERMS OF TRADE & INTEREST RATE SHOCKS**

**HINT 8: Substitution Effect with Interest Rate Changes**

**Topic:** How interest rate increase affects consumption via substitution effect

**Context:** Explaining substitution effect mechanism

> "So the substitution effect would say that with the increase in R, so let's take the example of the increase in interest rate, consumption today is gonna be more expensive, so the opportunity cost is higher because it's 1 + R goes from 1 + R, so let's say initially it's 1 + R and then it goes up to 1 + R plus delta, some increase in the interest rate. So then this would mean that my consumption today is going to. Decrease because it's more costly. **So if the good is more costly, in the example with in micro, if you have apple apples and pears, and the price of apples is going to increase, then you are going to start consuming relatively more, uh, pears**."

**Context:** Log utility always has substitution effect dominating

> "OK, so this is important and with the log utility which you will have in some of your, uh, classes, uh, **the characteristic of the log utility is going to be that the substitution effect is always going to dominate the wealth effect**. So that's why we very often use, uh, the logarithmic, uh, utility function in the examples that you get, uh, in your class and in general in macro."

**What she's talking about:** When r increases, C_1 decreases due to substitution effect (today's consumption more expensive). With log utility, substitution effect always dominates income effect.

**HINT 9: Terms of Trade Definition**

**Topic:** Relative price of exports to imports

**Context:** Defining terms of trade in the model

> "So then, uh, the relative price of exports in terms of imports is gonna be called terms of trade. It's just the definition, one of the prices, relative prices that we use in international economics. **So what is uh terms of trade in terms if you write it in our model** so the P1X is gonna be the price of uh exports XT and then P1M is gonna be the price of imports, OK?"

**What she's talking about:** TT = P_X / P_M (price of exports divided by price of imports). Example: oil-exporting country has P_X = oil price, P_M = bundle of imported goods

---

**HINT 10: Tariffs and General Equilibrium Effects**

**Topic:** Why consumption changes even when tariff revenue is rebated

**Context:** Student asks good question about tariff rebates

> "SPEAKER 1 I mean this is like a general equilibrium effect. **So it's a very good question**, but basically you're saying, OK, uh, the. SPEAKER 0 Because you say whatever is gonna be my consumption choice tomorrow is gonna depend. My government is just gonna get get without ECT, but you are the one who is deciding what C1 is, and that's gonna be a function of the prices. **The relative price is gonna be the price that has the tariff today**."

**What she's talking about:** Even if government rebates tariff revenue, your consumption choice still changes because relative prices change. This is a general equilibrium effect - you respond to the price with tariff, not to the rebate.

## **KEY PATTERNS IN EXAM HINTS**

### **Guaranteed Test Questions:**

1. ✅ Transversality condition (TRUE/FALSE) - "I want everybody to get this right"
2. ✅ NIIP = CA + valuation changes - "this would be again test question"
3. ✅ Signs of partial derivatives - mentioned as "very important"
4. ✅ Endogenous vs exogenous variables - "I might ask this on the test"

### **High Probability Topics:**

- Trade balance vs current account sign differences (true/false)
- Stock market performance → NIIP connection (explain the channel)
- Terms of trade definition and effects
- Tariff effects with general equilibrium
- Substitution vs income effects with log utility

### **Test Format (December 1st):**

- Covers Weeks 1-7 only (not Week 8)
- 8 multiple choice questions (mostly true/false)
- 2 short essay questions (14 marks each)
- Total: 20% of final grade

### **Her Advice:**

- Don't memorize formulas - derive them from basic identities
- Practice B and C problems from seminars (especially C - most representative of exam)
- Tests are easier than exams - "free 20%"
- If you panic on exam, work from first principles
- Close book and try to derive everything yourself
