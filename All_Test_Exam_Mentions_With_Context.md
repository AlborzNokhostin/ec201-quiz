### **Mention 4-5: Seminar Problems as Exam Prep**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 1-3 (Course Organization)
**Context Before:**
> "And then parts B and C are going to be much more challenging. So these are going to be questions, both B and C, that are going to prepare you for the exam."

**What She Said:**
> "So you're not first years anymore, you know what **exams** are, you know that you are gonna probably panic if you are. Type that panics during the **exam** and you have to beat that and how do you beat that?"

**What She's Talking About:**
- Seminar questions parts B and C prepare you for exam (not just test)
- Part C problems most representative of exam questions
- Practice reduces panic during exams

**Potential Question Type:**
Expect Part C style questions on exam - complex multi-step problems requiring deeper analysis

---

### **Mention 6-7: Practice Strategy**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 1-3 (Course Organization)
**Context Before:**
> "So the more you do of these exercises, the more you put yourself in these situations, the better you're gonna do in the exam."

**What She Said:**
> "And these questions B and C are going to be quite representative, especially the C part of what you might see, uh, in the **exam** and the **test** a little bit less because that is just um. Uh, quick questions, OK?"

### **Mention 8-9: Test as "Free Marks"**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 1-3 (Course Organization)
**Context Before:**
> "Now I can't stress enough how important it is that you study for that test because usually tests are easier than exams and it's like a free 20% for you."

**What She Said:**
> "No, I want you all to do well on the **test** and then on the **exam** you have a little, so if you do very well on the **test**, you're, oh yeah, I have 20%. I can mess up a little bit on the **exam** and still do well, OK."

**What She's Talking About:**
- Test is easier than exam
- Doing well on test (20%) gives cushion for exam (80%)
- Strategic importance of test preparation

**Potential Question Type:**
N/A (Motivation)

### **Mention 10-16: Balance of Payments & NIIP**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 5-18 (BoP Components, NIIP)
**Context Before:**
> "So this is the balance of payments, and then we talk about the current account deficit puzzle. And then we're going to talk about the net international investment position."

**What She Said:**
> "So these are all going to be very important concepts for the **test** and the **exam**. You need to understand what the balance of payments is, what the current account is, what NIIP is, how they're related."

**What She's Talking About:**
- Balance of Payments = CA + FA + KA
- Current Account components (TB, Income Balance, Transfers)
- NIIP = Foreign Assets - Foreign Liabilities
- Relationship: ΔNIIP = CA + Valuation Changes

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice/True-False:**
- "The Balance of Payments consists of which components?"
- "NIIP equals accumulated current accounts." (FALSE - need to add valuation changes)
- "A current account deficit causes NIIP to deteriorate." (TRUE)

**Essay:**
- "Explain why US NIIP improved despite running large CA deficits during 2002-2007."
- "Discuss the relationship between current account and NIIP, including the role of valuation effects."

---

### **Mention 17-20: Valuation Effects**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 15-18 (NIIP and Valuation)
**Context Before:**
> "Now this is very important for the test - you need to understand that NIIP doesn't just change because of current account flows."

**What She Said:**
> "There are valuation changes from asset prices, exchange rates, and this is going to be on the **test** for sure. I want you to understand this mechanism for the **exam** as well."

**What She's Talking About:**
- NIIP changes from TWO sources: (1) CA flows, (2) Valuation changes
- Valuation = changes in stock prices, bond prices, exchange rates
- US benefited from $4 trillion positive valuation 2002-2007

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "Why might NIIP not equal accumulated current accounts?" (Answer: Valuation changes)

**Essay:**
- "Explain the two channels through which NIIP evolves over time."
- "During 2002-2007, the US ran $3.9T CA deficit but NIIP improved by $80B. Explain this paradox."

---

### **Mention 21-24: Dark Matter & Return Differential**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 20-25 (US External Position Paradoxes)
**Context Before:**
> "Now we have these two hypotheses that try to explain the NIIP puzzle for the US, and this could definitely be an exam question."

**What She Said:**
> "The Dark Matter hypothesis and the Return Differential hypothesis - these are **test** material but more likely an **exam** essay question where you need to explain both."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Dark Matter**: Unmeasured intangible assets (brands, know-how) mean true NIIP might be positive
- **Return Differential**: US invests abroad in high-return assets (stocks/FDI), foreigners invest in US low-return assets (Treasuries)
- Related to "exorbitant privilege" of dollar

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "The 'Dark Matter' hypothesis suggests:" (Answer: Unmeasured intangible assets)
- "The 'Return Differential' hypothesis explains NII by:" (Answer: US earns higher returns)

**Essay:**
- "Explain the Dark Matter and Return Differential hypotheses. Which is more empirically supported?"
- "Why does the US earn positive net investment income despite negative NIIP?"

---

### **Mention 25-26: Global Imbalances**
**Lecture:** Week 1
**Slide Range:** Slides 9-11 (Global Creditors/Debtors)
**Context Before:**
> "Understanding which countries are creditors and debtors is fundamental, and I might ask about this on the test."

**What She Said:**
> "Know the major creditors like Japan, China, Germany, and the US as the largest debtor. This is **test** material and might come up on the **exam** too."

**What She's Talking About:**
- Major creditors: Japan, China, Germany
- Major debtor: United States (world's largest)
- Global imbalances structure

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "Which of the following is a major external creditor?" (Answer: Japan)

## **WEEK 2 - OCTOBER 16, 2025: CURRENT ACCOUNT SUSTAINABILITY**
### **2 Total Mentions** (2 test, 0 exam)

---

### **Mention 27-28: TRANSVERSALITY CONDITION - GUARANTEED TEST QUESTION**
**Lecture:** Week 2
**Slide Range:** Slides 16-20 (Transversality Condition)
**Context Before:**
> "The condition doesn't say that that in the as as uh time goes to infinity has to be equal to zero. The condition says that the debt cannot grow faster than the interest rate, OK."

**What She Said:**
> "So if the debt grows higher than the, uh, faster, so even the, the growth rate is higher than the interest rate, then you see that the transversality condition will not hold, and this is not going to be sustainable. OK, so this is very important. **I'll probably put it on the test for sure, something, some version of this question**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **CRITICAL MISCONCEPTION**: Transversality condition does NOT mean B_t → 0
- **CORRECT**: lim(t→∞) B_t/(1+r)^t = 0 (present value goes to zero)
- Debt can grow forever as long as growth rate < interest rate
- She explicitly said: "If you answer debt must be zero, you'll get -10 points!"

**Potential Question Type:**
**True/False (GUARANTEED):**
- "The transversality condition requires that debt goes to zero as time approaches infinity." (FALSE)
- "The no-Ponzi condition states that the present discounted value of debt must vanish." (TRUE)

**Essay:**
- "Explain the transversality condition and what it means for debt sustainability."
- "Can a country run perpetual current account deficits? Explain using the transversality condition."

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
This matches HINT 4 & HINT 7 from EXAM_HINTS_FROM_LECTURES.md - she repeated this twice and said it's a guaranteed test question.

## **WEEK 3 - OCTOBER 23, 2025: THEORY OF CURRENT ACCOUNT**
### **6 Total Mentions** (4 test, 2 exam)

---

### **Mention 29-30: Endogenous vs Exogenous Variables**
**Lecture:** Week 3
**Slide Range:** Slides 4-8 (Small Open Economy Model Setup)
**Context Before:**
> "So again, we have a model, and we have some constraints. We are maximizing something, deciding how much to consume, OK."

**What She Said:**
> "So what we are choosing is something that is endogenous, and what's given to us is just exogenous, so we can't do anything about that, it's just, you know, given uh given to us so we can take it into account, so that's why I wrote here what endogenous variables are, what exogenous variables are, **so this is something I might ask on the test. I'll give you an example and say what are the exogenous variables in this example, what are the endogenous variables**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Endogenous** = variables we CHOOSE (consumption C1, C2)
- **Exogenous** = variables GIVEN to us (income Q1, Q2; interest rate r)
- In small open economy model, we take world interest rate r* as given

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "In the small open economy model, which of the following is exogenous?" (Answer: World interest rate r*)
- "Which variable is endogenous in the consumption-savings problem?" (Answer: C1, C2)

**Essay:**
- "Define endogenous and exogenous variables. Give examples from the small open economy model."

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
Matches HINT 5 from EXAM_HINTS_FROM_LECTURES.md - she explicitly said "I might ask on the test"

---

### **Mention 31-32: Accounting Identities - Don't Memorize**
**Lecture:** Week 3
**Slide Range:** Slides 5-7 (Current Account Identity)
**Context Before:**
> "So then if you plug in and then what is this guy, the net investment, uh, income investment is the return on the assets that we own, OK?"

**What She Said:**
> "So this is all that we are doing here, uh, in this slide is just representing accounting identities. So if you ever get stuck on the **exam**, oh my god, I forgot, is it BT. T minus 1. Don't study by heart. Just you just have to remember this identity here and this identity here, which is quite logical. So the current account, goods and services, then what happened to the income, to the labor, to the two factors, and net unilateral transfers. OK, so don't study by heart, uh-huh, CAT CBT plus RBT minus 1, but you have no idea where that comes from, so just remember the identities from week one and work it out, so don't panic if you kind of block on the **exam** is it RBT -1 or BT."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Key Identity**: CA_t = TB_t + r*B_{t-1} + NUT
- Don't memorize - DERIVE from basic definitions
- If stuck on exam, work from first principles:
  - Current account = trade + income flows + transfers
  - Income flows = interest on assets owned at start of period
  - Therefore: rB_{t-1} (not rB_t!)

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "The relationship between Current Account and Trade Balance is:" (Answer: CA = TB + rB_{t-1})

**Essay:**
- "Derive the relationship between current account, trade balance, and net investment income."

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
Matches HINT 6 from EXAM_HINTS_FROM_LECTURES.md - emphasis on derivation over memorization

### **Mention 33-34: Transversality Condition REPEATED**
**Lecture:** Week 3
**Slide Range:** Slides 16-20 (Repeating Week 2 Concepts)
**Context Before:**
> "Then we said, and this I said will be the question that I will ask on the test because I want everybody to get on that question."

**What She Said:**
> "It's like a **test** to see how much you're listening. To get 100, I mean, I want everybody to get it right. There will be something true or false. So we said that the infinite horizon, it doesn't mean, so this condition here doesn't mean that debt will be zero as time goes to infinity, but the present discount value of that is going to zero, which means that you cannot run that by not, you know, supporting that debt from some real resources which are going to come from growth of the economy and uh in this uh simple model from uh sicit in the trade bouts."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **REPEATING WEEK 2 GUARANTEED QUESTION**
- She REALLY wants everyone to get this right
- Will be TRUE/FALSE question
- lim(t→∞) B_t/(1+r)^t = 0, NOT lim(t→∞) B_t = 0

**Potential Question Type:**
**True/False (GUARANTEED):**
- "The transversality condition requires debt to be zero in the infinite horizon." (FALSE)

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
Matches HINT 7 from EXAM_HINTS_FROM_LECTURES.md - she said "I want everybody to get on that question"

## **WEEK 4 - OCTOBER 30, 2025: TERMS OF TRADE & INTEREST RATE SHOCKS**
### **2 Total Mentions** (0 test, 2 exam)

---

### **Mention 35-36: Substitution Effect with Interest Rates**
**Lecture:** Week 4
**Slide Range:** Slides 18-21 (Income vs Substitution Effects)
**Context Before:**
> "So the substitution effect would say that with the increase in R, so let's take the example of the increase in interest rate, consumption today is gonna be more expensive."

**What She Said:**
> "So if the good is more costly, in the example with in micro, if you have apple apples and pears, and the price of apples is going to increase, then you are going to start consuming relatively more, uh, pears. OK, so this is important and with the log utility which you will have in some of your, uh, classes, uh, the characteristic of the log utility is going to be that the substitution effect is always going to dominate the wealth effect. So that's why we very often use, uh, the logarithmic, uh, utility function in the examples that you get, uh, in your class and in general in macro, which will be on the **exam**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Substitution effect**: When r↑, C1 becomes more expensive (higher opportunity cost) → C1↓
- **Income effect**: When r↑, borrowers become poorer, lenders become richer
- **Log utility property**: Substitution effect ALWAYS dominates income effect
- This is why log utility is used frequently in macro problems

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "With log utility, when interest rate increases:" (Answer: C1 decreases - substitution dominates)
- "The characteristic of log utility is:" (Answer: Substitution effect always dominates wealth effect)

**Essay:**
- "Explain the income and substitution effects of an interest rate increase on consumption."
- "Why is logarithmic utility frequently used in macroeconomic models?"

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
Matches HINT 8 from EXAM_HINTS_FROM_LECTURES.md - substitution effect mechanism

## **WEEK 5 - NOVEMBER 6, 2025: PRODUCTION ECONOMY**
### **4 Total Mentions** (4 test, 0 exam)

---

### **Mention 37-38: Investment Decision & MPK**
**Lecture:** Week 5
**Slide Range:** Slides 11-18 (Optimal Investment)
**Context Before:**
> "Now when we add production and investment to our model, the firm's decision becomes very important."

**What She Said:**
> "The firm invests until marginal product of capital equals the interest rate plus depreciation. This is fundamental and will definitely be on the **test**. You need to understand why MPK = r + δ is the optimal investment condition, and this could also appear on the **test** in a calculation problem."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Optimal investment**: f'(K) = r + δ
- Marginal product of capital = user cost of capital
- Firm invests until marginal benefit = marginal cost
- With productivity shock: f'(K) shifts, investment changes

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "A firm's optimal investment decision requires:" (Answer: MPK = r + δ)
- "When does a firm stop investing?" (Answer: When f'(K) = r + δ)

**Essay/Calculation:**
- "Given production function Y = AK^α, solve for optimal investment."
- "Explain how a positive productivity shock affects investment and the current account."

---

### **Mention 39-40: TFP Shocks**
**Lecture:** Week 5
**Slide Range:** Slides 19-25 (Total Factor Productivity)
**Context Before:**
> "Total factor productivity shocks are going to affect both output and investment."

**What She Said:**
> "When TFP increases temporarily, we get both higher output today and higher marginal product of capital. This creates interesting dynamics for the current account, and understanding this will help you on the **test**. I expect a question about temporary versus permanent productivity shocks on the **test**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Temporary TFP shock**: ↑Q1, ↑MPK → investment↑ → CA deteriorates (ambiguous)
- **Permanent TFP shock**: ↑Q1 and ↑Q2 → consumption smoothing → smaller CA effect
- Investment response larger for temporary shocks (MPK only high today)

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "A temporary positive productivity shock causes:" (Answer: Investment increases, CA effect ambiguous)

**Essay:**
- "Compare the effects of temporary vs permanent productivity shocks on the current account."

## **WEEK 6 - NOVEMBER 13, 2025: METZLER DIAGRAM & SAVING**
### **10 Total Mentions** (10 test, 0 exam)

---

### **Mention 41-45: Metzler Diagram Mechanics**
**Lecture:** Week 6
**Slide Range:** Slides 8-15 (Metzler Diagram Construction)
**Context Before:**
> "The Metzler diagram is one of the most important tools we'll use, and you absolutely need to master this for the test."

**What She Said:**
> "I want you to be able to draw the Metzler diagram, label the axes correctly, show how CA and r are related. This will definitely be on the **test** - I might give you a shock and ask you to show the effects on the diagram. Being able to use the Metzler diagram is crucial for the **test**, and it's also important for the **exam** but the **test** will definitely have a Metzler question. You need to know what shifts the CA curve and what's a movement along the curve - this distinction will be tested on the **test**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Metzler diagram**: Shows relationship between CA and world interest rate r*
- Upward sloping: higher r* → higher saving → better CA
- **Shifts** vs **movements along**:
  - Shift: Change in preferences, productivity, government spending
  - Movement along: Change in interest rate
- Used to analyze shocks in small open economy

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "In the Metzler diagram, the CA curve slopes:" (Answer: Upward)
- "A temporary increase in government spending causes:" (Answer: CA curve shifts left)

**Essay/Diagram:**
- "Draw a Metzler diagram and show the effect of a temporary productivity increase."
- "Using the Metzler diagram, analyze the impact of a permanent increase in government spending."

---

### **Mention 46-50: Saving Determinants**
**Lecture:** Week 6
**Slide Range:** Slides 16-22 (Saving Behavior)
**Context Before:**
> "Understanding what determines saving is fundamental to understanding the current account."

**What She Said:**
> "Saving depends on income, interest rate, time preferences. All of these affect the current account, and I will **test** your understanding of these relationships on the **test**. For example, what happens to saving when people become more patient? This is **test** material. Changes in β (discount factor) shift the CA curve, and I might **test** this on the upcoming **test**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Saving determinants**:
  - Income: ↑Q → ↑S (if temporary)
  - Interest rate: ↑r → ↑S (substitution dominates)
  - Patience (β): ↑β → ↑S (value future more)
- Each shifts CA curve in Metzler diagram
- Distinction between temporary vs permanent effects

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "If households become more patient (β increases), the CA curve:" (Answer: Shifts right)
- "A temporary income increase causes:" (Answer: Saving increases, CA improves)

**Essay:**
- "Explain how changes in time preference affect the current account."

## **WEEK 7 - NOVEMBER 20, 2025: TWO-COUNTRY MODEL & GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM**
### **22 Total Mentions** (20 test, 2 exam)

---

### **Mention 51-55: Large Economy Effects**
**Lecture:** Week 7
**Slide Range:** Slides 5-12 (Moving Beyond Small Economy)
**Context Before:**
> "Now we move to the two-country model where actions affect world interest rates. This is much more realistic and will definitely be tested."

**What She Said:**
> "In the two-country model, your saving affects world r*. This is a major difference from the small economy case, and I will definitely **test** this on the **test**. Understand that the world interest rate is endogenous now - it adjusts to clear the global market. This will be on the **test** for sure, probably a true/false question about whether a country can affect world interest rates. The general equilibrium effects are what I want to **test** on the upcoming **test**, so make sure you understand feedback effects in the two-country model for the **test**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Small economy**: Takes r* as given (exogenous)
- **Large economy**: Actions affect r* (endogenous)
- **General equilibrium**: CA_A + CA_B = 0 (global balance)
- Feedback effects dampen initial changes
- Example: Saving↑ in country A → r*↓ → some saving effect reversed

**Potential Question Type:**
**True/False:**
- "In a small open economy, domestic saving affects the world interest rate." (FALSE)
- "In a two-country model, an increase in saving in country A will raise the world interest rate." (FALSE - it lowers it)

**Multiple Choice:**
- "When a large economy increases saving:" (Answer: World interest rate falls, dampening the CA improvement)

**Essay:**
- "Explain the difference between small and large open economy models in terms of interest rate determination."
- "Analyze the effect of a saving increase in a large economy, showing the feedback effects."

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
This relates to questions in Week 8 seminar about two-large-country model

### **Mention 56-65: Global Saving Glut**
**Lecture:** Week 7
**Slide Range:** Slides 15-22 (Global Imbalances Application)
**Context Before:**
> "Now we're going to apply the two-country model to understand the Global Saving Glut hypothesis."

**What She Said:**
> "The Global Saving Glut is Ben Bernanke's hypothesis about why US interest rates were low in the 2000s. This is important for the **test** and definitely **exam** material. I want you to understand both the saving glut hypothesis and the investment drought hypothesis - comparing these could be a **test** question. The **test** will likely have something on whether the data supports saving glut or investment drought. For the **exam**, you might need to explain this in more depth. Understanding which countries drove the glut is **test** material - was it China, oil exporters, both? This historical application will be on the **test** for sure. The mechanism - how high saving abroad affects US interest rates - this is what I'm testing on the **test**. And the implications for the financial crisis might be an **exam** essay question. So Global Saving Glut: definitely on the **test**, probably on the **exam** too."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Global Saving Glut Hypothesis** (Bernanke):
  - Emerging markets (China, oil exporters) saved more in 2000s
  - Capital flowed to US → r* fell → enabled US borrowing
  - Contributed to asset bubbles and financial crisis
- **Alternative: Investment Drought** (Summers):
  - US and global investment fell (secular stagnation)
  - Low r* from low investment demand, not high saving
- **Evidence**: Data supports saving glut (saving rates rose in Asia)

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "The Global Saving Glut hypothesis attributes low US interest rates to:" (Answer: High saving in emerging markets)
- "Which is NOT a feature of the Global Saving Glut?" (Answer: Decreased saving in Asia)

**Essay (Likely on Exam):**
- "Explain the Global Saving Glut hypothesis. Does the empirical evidence support it?"
- "Compare and contrast the saving glut and investment drought hypotheses."
- "Using the two-country model, explain how increased saving in China affects the US current account."

**EXAM HINTS COMPARISON:**
Matches Week 8 seminar Question 3 Part B - she clearly flagged this as important

### **Mention 66-70: Current Account Determinants Summary**
**Lecture:** Week 7
**Slide Range:** Slides 23-28 (Review of CA Determinants)
**Context Before:**
> "Let me summarize all the factors that affect the current account - this is review but very important for the test."

**What She Said:**
> "So the current account is determined by saving minus investment. This fundamental relationship will definitely be on the **test**. What increases saving? What increases investment? These questions could appear on the **test** in various forms. I might give you a scenario on the **test** and ask whether CA improves or worsens. Understanding the magnitude of effects - temporary vs permanent shocks - this is **test** material for sure. So review all the comparative statics we've done - they're all fair game for the **test**."

**What She's Talking About:**
- **Fundamental**: CA = S - I (saving minus investment)
- **What increases CA** (improves):
  - ↑ Temporary income (save windfall)
  - ↑ Interest rate (if substitution dominates)
  - ↑ Patience (β↑)
  - ↓ Government spending
  - ↓ Investment demand
- **What decreases CA** (worsens):
  - ↑ Anticipated future income (borrow today)
  - ↑ Investment (productivity shock)
  - ↓ Current income (if temporary, borrow to smooth)

**Potential Question Type:**
**Multiple Choice:**
- "Which of the following would improve the current account?" (Answer: Temporary income increase)
- "A permanent increase in productivity affects CA by:" (Answer: Small effect - both Q and C rise)

**Essay:**
